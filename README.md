    <!-- Steps are listed below -->

1. I only added the HTML and CSS files - I did this since any file in my work should be important. By only using these two I limited my search pool for finding solutions to my problems. Having js as another solution could have gotten me more confused

2. To hit requirement 2, I needed to add a form for the users to select there date in a calender, I did this by

3. Makign it responsive was easy since its just adding media queries


4. I didn't use any, HOWEVER, I did intend on it though due to no time in my personal life I couldnt find space to do it well

    <!-- DIFFICULTIES -->

1. I had a VERY hard time finding how to get the API to show me an image, turns out it was a small issue with how i had used capitals. My javaScript was searching for and image when i had my html listed as Image. the capital "I" being the only difference

2. I encountered a difficulty in applying an image in the background of my website, being as mine currently in the mockup shows a space background. I am going to instead get around this by making stars on a dark purple bg colour.

3. Currently struggling to get the image to follow the max width im stating, i am attempting to redo all of my media queries,
-   So it turns out i was doing the same mistake as my firs issue... so ugh thats embaressing
