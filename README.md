Capstone Project - Part 1
_________________
<!-- Capstone Project Part 2 -->
Because I was using the Astrology picture of the day website, I focused on keeping the overall design simple and user accesible. I chose to use a space background to maintain the Nasa theme that is going on though choose white colours for the fonts allowed me to create an easily readable contrast.

1. I chose to make the website broken solely between The search engine page (Calender Page) - And the favourites section that way the user can look more at space and less at my websites UI.

2. One design choice that stands out is that I used the NASA logo for the letter "O" in the title, I feel this adds some personality to the design while also being another reminder of who the company running this website is.
